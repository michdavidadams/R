# Range of ankle motion is a contributing factor to falls among the elderly. Suppose a team of researchers is studying how compression hosiery, typical shoes, and medical shoes affect range of ankle motion. In particular, note the variables Barefoot and Footwear5. Barefoot represents a subject's range of ankle motion (in degrees) while barefoot, and Footwear5 represents their range of ankle motion (in degrees) while wearing compression hosiery and medical shoes.
	# Use this data and your preferred software to calculate the equation of the least-squares linear regression line to predict a subject's range of ankle motion while wearing compression hosiery and medical shoes, ùë¶ÃÇ, based on their range of ankle motion while barefoot, ùë•. Round your coefficients to two decimal places of precision.
	ankles <- read.csv("/Users/michaeladams/Code/R/Chapter 12/ankles.csv")
	barefoot <- ankles$Barefoot
	footwear5 <- ankles$FW5
	lm(formula = footwear5 ~ barefoot, data = ankles)
	# ùë¶ÃÇ= 13.31+0.46x
	# A physical therapist determines that her patient Jan has a range of ankle motion of 7.26¬∞ while barefoot. Predict Jan's range of ankle motion while wearing compression hosiery and medical shoes, ùë¶ÃÇ. Round your answer to two decimal places.
	13.31+0.46(7.26)	# ùë¶ÃÇ= 16.65
	# Suppose Jan's actual range of ankle motion while wearing compression hosiery and medical shoes is 9.79¬∞. Use her predicted range of ankle motion to calculate the residual associated with this value. Round your answer to two decimal places.
	16.65-9.79	# ùë¶ÃÇ= -6.86
	
# Suppose a simple linear regression model is used to explain the relationship between ùë• and ùë¶. A random sample of ùëõ=21 values for the independent variable was selected, and the corresponding values of the dependent variable were observed. Construct a scatter plot for these data and add the estimated regression line to it.
	# Estimate the true mean value of ùëå when ùë•=62.
