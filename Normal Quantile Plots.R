hist(rivers)	# distribution doesn't look normal
qqnorm(rivers)	# does not fall in straight line, so probability isn't normal
qqline(rivers)	# adds straight line to confirm qqnorm

hist(Exam1)	# suggets data is normally distributed
qqnorm(Exam1)	# appears straight line relationship
qqline(Exam1)	# confirmed straight line distribution
